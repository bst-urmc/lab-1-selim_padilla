# Data



To find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: 
```?datasaurus_dozen``` 


1. Based on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the `datasaurus_dozen` file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? Add your responses to your lab report. When you're done, commit your changes with the commit message "Added answer for Ex 1", and push



 I typed the command in console.DataSaurus Dozen has 1846 rows and 3 variables. Given the format of Datasaurus Dozen, there are 3 variables: x values,y-values , and dataset which indicates the data are from.





Let's take a look at what these datasets are. To do so we can make a *frequency table* of the dataset variable:

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset) %>%
  print(13)
```

```

The original Datasaurus (`dino`) was created by Alberto Cairo in [this great blog post](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html). The other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper *Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics* through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice. In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of datasets that the same summary statistics to the Datasaurus but have very different distributions.

# Data visualization and summary

2. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `dino` dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset.



```{r}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")
```



```{r fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()

```

```{r}
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```


3. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `star` dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset. How does this value compare to the `r` of `dino`?
```{r}
bullseye_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "bullseye")
```
```{r fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
ggplot(data = bullseye_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r}
bullseye_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```


4. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `circle` dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset. How does this value compare to the `r` of `dino`?
```{r}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")
```
```{r}
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```




```{marginfigure}
Facet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don't add a legend.
```

5. Finally, let's plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.

```{r all-viz, eval=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

And we can use the `group_by` function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients.

```{r all-r, eval=FALSE}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y)) %>%
  print(13)
```

You're done with the data analysis exercises, but we'd like you to do two more things:

```{r fig-resize-global, echo=TRUE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.width=5}
#knitr::include_graphics("lab01-hello-r/img/fig-resize-global.png")
```

- **Resize your figures:** 

Click on the gear icon in on top of the R Markdown document, and select "Output Options..." in the dropdown menu. In the pop up dialogue box go to the Figures tab and change the height and width of the figures, and hit OK when done. Then, knit your document and see how you like the new sizes. Change and knit again and again until you're happy with the figure sizes. Note that these values get saved in the YAML.

```{r fig-resize-local, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=15}
#knitr::include_graphics("lab01-hello-r/img/fig-resize-local.png")
```

You can also use different figure sizes for different figures. To do so click on the gear icon within the chunk where you want to make a change. Turn on "Use custom figure size" and enter the size for this figure. Changing the figure sizes added new options to these chunks: `fig.width` and `fig.height`. You can change them by defining different values directly in your R Markdown document as well with code like this:

```
knitr::opts_chunk(fig.width=3, fig.height=15)
```

```{r theme-highlight, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
#knitr::include_graphics("lab01-hello-r/img/theme-highlight.png")
```
